    -------------------------* HTML PART *-------------------------------
_ NAVIGATION BAR: I used a "header" tag which contain inside "img" tag which contain teh LOGO image and "ul " tag & "il" tags inside of it + a search input field in a "div" then we close our "header" tag 
_ BANNER : I used a simple "div" tag to regroup all the other content of the page so firstly i nested the background image then I created an other "div" tag with class (content) that will contain all the rest page's content such as "span" tag to represent movie's informations and "p" tag for a paragraph that describes brievely the movie's story , then finally I added 02 buttons using a "div" and 02 "a" tags then I closed all "div" tags
_BOTTOM : we used an "a" tag still in the mean "div" of the page I inserted a play image and a video using of course "video" tag to watch the Trailer of the movie then all of "div" tags are closed as well as the mean one .
